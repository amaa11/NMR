Normalized Movement Rate (NMR) is a proxy that examines the stability of any XAI method when generating list of most informative predictors. It tests how the order of the informative predictors will be chnaged when there is collinearity among the predictors. Its values ranges from 0 to 1. NMR = 1 means there is a sharp change in the order of the predictors when some features are iteratively removed from the model and accordingly the list is unstable.<br>
